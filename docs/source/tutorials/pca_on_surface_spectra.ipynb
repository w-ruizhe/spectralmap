    "# Principal Component Analysis on the Surface Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial inhomogeneities observed in brown dwarfs have been hypothesized to arise from variations in cloud opacity, temperature structure, and thermochemical instabilities. To help disentangle these mechanisms, we perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the logarithm of surface spectra, which identifies orthogonal directions in spectral space that successively capture the dominant sources of spectral variation. We choose logarithm space because PCA is a linear operation and the opacity effects become linear in the log space of spectra. This is similar to standardizing the features and prevent PCA from being dominated by wavelengths that have large amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the logarithm of surface spectra to be $\\mathbf{X} = \\log \\mathbf{Y} = \\{\\log \\boldsymbol{I}_\\lambda\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times M}$ and perform a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the mean-subtracted matrix $\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}} = \\mathbf{U}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathbf{V}^\\top.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The columns of $\\mathbf{V}$ are the principal-component directions in spectral space, and the diagonal elements of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ are the singular values, whose squares give the variance explained by each component. The explained variance ratio of the first few principal components tells us how many dominant components are needed to approximate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leading component primarily traces changes in the overall flux level, while higher-order components encode more subtle spectral variations that can be linked to differences in cloud opacity, temperature gradients, or molecular abundances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can project the matrix $\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}$ onto the Principal Component Plane (PCP):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{P} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\,\\mathbf{V},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where each row of $\\mathbf{P}$ contains the principal component amplitudes (scores) for a given surface grid point. Comparing to grouping in the spectra space, this prevents grouping being dominated in the high-variance direction (e.g. cloud), allowing to pick up meaningful variations in secondary directions (e.g. chemistry).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although principal components are mathematically orthogonal, the distribution of projected data often retains significant structures. We aim to isolate the distinct end-members that capture the total surface spectral variability. To do so, we identify the optimal polygon within the projected data's (${\\mathbf{P}}$) convex hull that maximizes number of enclosed points. For Luhman 16B, the surface spectra distribute along three primary axes in the principal component plane, resulting in a triangular fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because hemispherically averaged observations provide limited constraints on small spatial scales, individual spatial spectra carry high uncertainties. We mitigate this by averaging spectrally correlated regions. We assign the end-member spectra to their nearest neighbors and take the mean as the final spectral components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\ell_n$ be the assignment of the n-th spatial spectrum. Then $N_k = \\sum_{n=1}^{L} \\mathbb{I}(\\ell_n = k)$ is the number of points within group $k$. We define the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times L}$ by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{W}_{kn} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\dfrac{1}{N_k}, & \\text{if } \\ell_n = k, \\\\[4pt]\n",
    "0,              & \\text{otherwise}.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $\\mathbf{X} = \\log \\mathbf{Y} $ is the logarithm of the surface spectrum. The cluster-mean spectra are then\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times M},\n",

    "Let $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{\\lambda} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ denote the covariance matrix of the spatial points at wavelength index $\\lambda$ (for $\\lambda=1,\\dots,M$) (Equation \\ref{eq:posterior}). The covariance of the cluster-mean spectra at wavelength $w$ is\n",
    "$$\n",

    "and the 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty on the mean spectrum of cluster $k$ at wavelength $\\lambda$ is\n",

    "\\sigma_{k}^{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\text{cluster},kk}^{\\lambda}}.\n",

    "In summary, we have used these principal components both as a diagnostic and as a dimensionality-reduction tool: they provide a compact basis for visualizing the dominant patterns of variability and motivate our adoption of a small number of characteristic atmospheric zones. In particular, the fact that the first one or two components capture the vast majority of the variance and the surface spectra exhibit obvious patterns in the PCP supports the assumption that only a few distinct spectral states are required to describe the surface. To find such spectral states, we identify groups in the PCP plane. They correspond to the most strongly differentiated combinations of the leading modes of variability that we subsequently model using detailed retrievals."

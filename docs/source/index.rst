spectralmap
===========

A package for **rotational + eclipse/occultation surface mapping**, with optional
**wavelength-resolved (“spectral”)** inference.

This documentation is intentionally structured in a **starry-like** way (clear user guide +
examples + API reference). Most pages are placeholders for now — fill in details as you build.
